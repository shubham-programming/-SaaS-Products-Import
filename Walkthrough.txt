		2. Open the solution SaaSProductsImport.sln in VisualStudio 2019 .
		3. Run the solution with prerequisite as in next section .
		
  - How to run your code / tests
		1. Create Directory C:\Work\feed-products and place files to be processed in it . In case of URL we need to add URL in appsettings.json .
		2. Run the 'SaaSProductsImport' project .
		3. To Run the tests -> RunTest on 'SaaSProductsImportUnitTests' project. No perquisite needs to be followed in running tests.
  - Where to find your code
		1. Github Repository - https://github.com/shubham-programming/-SaaS-Products-Import
		
  - Was it your first time writing a unit test, using a particular framework, etc?
		No , I have written unit test cases using RihnoMocks and Moq framework in my professional experience.
  - What would you have done differently if you had had more time
		1.I would have implemented Multi-threading in reading files from multiple import sources [ ex -folder,url,FTP etc.] to increase performance of application using parallel processing.
		2.I would have introduced more exception handling to handle error scenarios in file read/parsing operations.
		3.I would have thought of way to create a generic parser which would be inherited by .Json,.Yaml or different file-extension classes to reduce line of codes and increased readability of code.
